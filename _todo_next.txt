1. Fix left side float
2. On left side float end, in right side reassign new icon and new scale
3. Generate only as many bubbles as needed to fill the width
4. Calculate all bubbles in full width. Add items to half in which its bounding box falls in
  Once item crosses both halfs, there should be two bubbles spawned
    left side should have bubble entering
    right half should have bubble leaving
5. Two div elements, absolute positioned, cover absolute on top
6. Resize:
  Animate translation
  On resize, move translation in percentage (add percentage values to bubbles, but for transform use pixels)
  Set min/max scale
