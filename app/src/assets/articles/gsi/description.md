## Description

Working as part of the team developing tools used to display and manipulate a wide range of geospatial data collected from satellites, plane and drone imagery which is analysed by GSI Machine Learning team to produce insight into the collected data.

Mostly used technologies for web app development were: Angular, Node.js, and Postgres; For hosting: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Serverless and Kubernetes; For continuos testing and deployment (CI/CD): Gitlab CI.

During time at GSI I was working on developing, documenting, testing, deploying and maintaining the core product Visual Intelligence Platform (VIP) and couple other projects. Some of the technical work highlights include:

* Proposed usage of Kubernetes and Serverless solutions for better scalability and migrated monolith server on single VM to Microservices
* Building database architecture to store large and complex datasets, making various performance optimisations to modify, read and send/render it in the web UI for different use cases
* Implementing complex multilevel permissions/access control to data (RBAC)
* Creating custom script that can be used with any CI tool to test and deploy all apps and services within project using single Git commit message
* Researching, documenting guidelines and implementing solutions to help improve and speed up development experience/time
* Migrating legacy VIP features to new system
* Build solution for fully white labeled system from UI to emails
* Working with various 3rd party APIs used for interacting with services, platforms, social networks and geospatial data providers
* PDF report generation on demand

Software development methodology was Agile, but not by the book, we mixed in some other best practices with time that better worked with the nature of projects. I've been helping to scope projects, review and set time estimates for projects, maintaining and creating tasks in Jira. While majority tasks in Jira were defined in meetings based on project requirements, some of the tasks I have added myself when approved by manager, as I was always thinking of what new features would be useful, what security issues are there to fix and other improvements.

Initially I joined a small developer team, after that for a while I was working mostly alone on the full stack web development projects, until new team was put together. Decent part of work, especially before leaving was writing quality documentation on everything I knew, from development to every system setup from a scratch related to the projects I've worked on, security setup for hosted services, known common issues and workarounds and anything else that would be of any use to the team. Alongside documentation I have worked on evaluating VIP system and writing a yearly security audit.

Besides working on full stack development I have assisted in hiring/interview processes for putting together new development team, training/assisting both junior and experienced developers and helping them get up to speed with the projects, which included assigning tasks based on experience, doing code reviews and providing feedback to help them improve, as well as listening to useful feedback and ideas.
